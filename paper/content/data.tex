\section{Data Preparation}
\label{sec:data}

We use the \href{https://github.com/frodonh/french-words}{\textbf{french-words}} dataset \cite{data_french_words}, which contains 691,969 French words. The limitation to the French language is arbitrary; the method presented here can be applied to any language that has phonetic transcriptions available â€” simply by replacing the underlying dataset.

It is compiled from several sources including (among others) the Debian package \href{https://packages.debian.org/fr/sid/wfrench}{wfrench}, \href{http://www.lexique.org/}{Lexique 3.83} \cite{data_lexique}, the \href{https://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/DonneesLinguistiques/Dictionnaires/telechargement.html}{DELA dictionary} \cite{data_dela} as well as the \href{https://github.com/hbenbel/French-Dictionary}{French-Dictionary} \cite{data_french_csv}. The words also contain \acrfull{pos} tagging information, \eg whether it is a noun, verb, adjective etc. It also comprises the usage frequency according to Lexique.org and Google Ngrams\footnote{We use the average of both sources (or just one if the other is missing).}.

Since the french-words dataset does not include phonetic transcriptions, we merge it with the \href{https://github.com/DanielSWolf/wiki-pronunciation-dict}{\textbf{wiki-pronunciation-dict}} \cite{data_pronunciation} dataset extracted from the French \href{https://fr.wiktionary.org/}{Wiktionnaire} to obtain 611,786 words with their \gls{ipa} transcription\footnote{If multiple phonetic transcription for the same word are available, we (arbitrarily) only store the first one to ease data handling.}.

Additionally, we extract all used phonetic symbols and assign integer IDs to them. This enables us to store the transcription as a list of integers. For our examples, we obtain \autoref{tab:phonetic-encoding}. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm will then work on these integer lists. Note that we consider \textipa{/dZ/} as one symbol, even though it is a combination of \textipa{/d/} and \textipa{/Z/}. The same applies to \textipa{/tS/}. This is to account for the different pronunciation of the combined symbols compared to the individual ones.
