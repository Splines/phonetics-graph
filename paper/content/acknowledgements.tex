\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Christophe Picard for his lecture that introduced me to GPU computing and for reviewing this paper. Furthermore, I am grateful to the Gephi contributors for their software that made it possible to visualize the graphs in this paper. I also want to thank all people who compiled the various datasets, without which this work would not have been possible.
