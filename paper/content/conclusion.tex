\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% Computation
% - stencil computation -> try to parallelize at finer granularity
% - Calculate more words at the same time by filtering uninteresting weights
%   directly (for this purpose generate histogram of weights distribution)

% Domain Level
% - fine-tune similarity matrix for language subtleties
% - experiment with parameters: match/mismatch score, gap penalty p
% - consider lexeme as those are more interesting
% - multiple languages (!)
% - offer online service to show neighbors of a word in a ego network
%   (users can search for a word)

% - more graph theory applications other than shortest path?


% normalize score to word length n+m


% todo lemma, lexeme
